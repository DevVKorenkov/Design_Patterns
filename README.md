# Design_Patterns
This project contains simple implementations of GoF (Gang of four) patterns in C# language. 
These implementations are from metanit.com (I strongly recommend to visit this site and learn a huge count of materials about C# and other programming languages) and they show in examples how these patterns work and why they exist.
