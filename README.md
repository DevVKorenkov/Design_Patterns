# Design_Patterns
This project contains simple implementations of GoF (Gang of four) patterns in C# language. 
These implementations are from metanit.com (I strongly recommend to visit this site and learn a huge count of materials about C# and other programming languages) and they show with examples how these patterns work and why they exist.

You can find a mind map which contains short definitions of these patterns. Follow the link https://coggle.it/diagram/ZFyO3QAjwnrfcSeJ/t/programming-design-patterns-design-pattern-big1
Also there is a pdf file and a jpg file in the solution.
